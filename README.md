# Dnsify
DNS lookup and Forensics built for use in Jaras but it can be used for domain verification use-cases in your projects.


The package works as follows, a verifications phrase is given to your user to be set on the DNS Server as TXT records, dnsify verifies if the given phrase exists on the dns server
and if not, it can return a forensics for checking the reason behind the failure.
